Dependencies Kata
=================

Based on http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_eighteen_t.html. 

After you have a working dependency calculator, look at the build.gradle files
 for each of the Hadapt packages and run your dependency calculator on them.
Ignore all of the external dependencies and just focus on the Hadapt-specific
dependencies.

You can either add to your dependency calculator so that it can take input 
from files, and create an input file with all of the relevant dependencies,
or put the Hadapt packages into your unit tests.
