Java Kata Base
==============

Use this repository to bootstrap a code kata written in Java.

It is set up with [JUnit][] and [Fest Asserts][] and a dummy class/test
for you to modify.

If you're looking for a kata to try, you can simply [Google for 'code kata list'][google-kata] but here are some good lists to get you started:

* https://github.com/garora/TDD-Katas/blob/master/README.md
* http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataCatalogue
* https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises
