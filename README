Dependencies Kata
=================

Based on http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_eighteen_t.html. 

After you have a working dependency calculator, look at the build.gradle files
 for each of the Hadapt packages and run your dependency calculator on them.
Ignore all of the external dependencies and just focus on the Hadapt-specific
dependencies.
